## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Setup Google Sheets API

Run the setup command to get instructions:

```bash
python main.py setup
```

Follow the instructions to:

1. Create a Google Cloud project
2. Enable Google Sheets API and Google Drive API
3. Create a service account and download credentials
4. Place `credentials.json` in the project root

### 3. Add Your First Listing

**Scrape from a rental listing URL:**

```bash
python main.py add --url "https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/..."
```

**Share with your partner:**

```bash
python main.py add --url "https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/..." --share-with "partner@email.com"
```

## Usage

### Add Listings

```bash
# Scrape a single URL
python main.py add --url "https://www.trulia.com/home/..."

# Scrape multiple URLs from a file
python main.py add --file "urls.txt"

# Add and share with partner
python main.py add --url "..." --share-with "partner@email.com"

# Force update all fields (ignore manual edits)
python main.py add --url "..." --reset-hashes

# Rescrape all URLs from the sheet (preserve manual edits)
python main.py rescrape

# Rescrape all URLs from the sheet (ignore manual edits)
python main.py rescrape --ignore-hashes

# Rescrape without confirmation prompts
python main.py rescrape --force
```

**Note**: The rescrape command now processes ALL URLs found in the sheet, including:

- Previously scraped listings
- Manually added listings
- Listings from any source

This ensures that even manually added URLs get updated with fresh data while preserving your notes and decisions.

**Manual Edit Protection**: The system automatically detects and preserves fields that you manually edit in Google Sheets. When you re-scrape a listing, only fields that haven't been manually modified will be updated.

**File Format**: Create a text file with one URL per line:

```text
https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/...
https://www.trulia.com/home/...
https://hotpads.com/...
```

### View All Listings

```bash
# Show table view
python main.py list

# Show detailed view with descriptions and amenities
python main.py list --detailed
```

### Update Notes

```bash
python main.py update-notes --url "https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/..." --notes "Great location, but expensive"
```

### Update Decision

```bash
python main.py update-decision --url "https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/..." --decision "Interested"
```

### Sort by Status

```bash
# Show what would be sorted without making changes
python main.py sort-by-status --dry-run

# Sort listings by decision status in priority order
python main.py sort-by-status
```

### Setup Data Validation

```bash
# Get instructions for setting up decision column dropdown
python main.py setup-validation

# Use a different sheet name
python main.py setup-validation --sheet-name "My Rentals"
```

**Note**: This command currently provides step-by-step manual setup instructions. Future versions will automate the dropdown creation.

### Clean Up Invalid Decisions

```bash
# Clean up invalid decision values to ensure dropdown compatibility
python main.py cleanup-decisions

# Skip confirmation prompt
python main.py cleanup-decisions --force

# Use a different sheet name
python main.py cleanup-decisions --sheet-name "My Rentals"
```

**Note**: This command finds and fixes any decision values that don't match the dropdown options.

### Share Sheet

```bash
python main.py share --email "partner@email.com"
```

### Clear All Listings

```bash
# Clear with confirmation prompt
python main.py clear

# Clear without confirmation (force)
python main.py clear --force
```

### Data Protection & Field Management

```bash
# Show which listings have notes
python main.py notes-status

# Show which fields are protected from overwriting
python main.py protection-status

# Manually protect specific fields
python main.py protect-fields --url "https://..." --fields "price,beds,notes"

# Remove protection from specific fields
python main.py unprotect-fields --url "https://..." --fields "price,beds"

# Reset hashes for a specific listing (allows force-updating all fields)
python main.py reset-hashes --url "https://..."
```

### Cache Management

```bash
# Show cache statistics
python main.py cache-stats

# Clear expired cache entries (default: 7 days)
python main.py cache-clear

# Clear cache entries older than 48 hours
python main.py cache-clear --max-age-hours 48
```

### Help & Setup

```bash
# Show detailed help for all commands
python main.py help

# Show setup instructions
python main.py setup
```

## Data Structure

Each listing includes:

- **URL**: Link to the rental listing
- **Address**: Property address
- **Price**: Monthly rent
- **Beds**: Number of bedrooms
- **Baths**: Number of bathrooms
- **Sqft**: Square footage
- **House Type**: Type of property (House, Townhouse, Apartment, etc.)
- **Description**: Property description
- **Amenities**: List of available amenities
- **Available Date**: When the property is available
- **Parking**: Parking information
- **Utilities**: What's included in rent
- **Contact Info**: Phone number or contact details
- **Appointment URL**: Link for scheduling viewings/applications
- **Scraped At**: When the data was collected
- **Notes**: Your personal notes (preserved during updates)
- **Decision**: Your decision on the property (preserved during updates)
  - **Valid options**: "Pending Review" (default), "Interested", "Shortlisted", "Rejected", "Appointment Scheduled"
  - **Input method**: Dropdown selection (set up with `setup-validation` command)
  - **Data integrity**: Automatically validated during rescraping and sorting operations

## Sorting Priority

The `sort-by-status` command organizes listings by decision status in the following priority order:

1. **Pending Review** - New listings that need your attention
2. **Interested** - Properties you're considering
3. **Shortlisted** - Top candidates for further review
4. **Appointment Scheduled** - Properties you're actively pursuing
5. **Rejected** - Properties you've decided against

This sorting ensures that your highest-priority listings (those requiring action) appear at the top of the sheet.

## Dropdown Compatibility & Data Integrity

The decision column now enforces dropdown validation to ensure data consistency:

### **Automatic Validation**

- **Rescraping**: Decision values are automatically validated before writing to the sheet
- **Sorting**: All decision values are validated during sort operations
- **Updates**: Decision updates are normalized to valid dropdown options
- **Data Protection**: Invalid values are automatically converted to "Pending Review"

### **Validation Methods**

- **`setup-validation`**: Sets up the dropdown in Google Sheets
- **`cleanup-decisions`**: Finds and fixes any existing invalid decision values
- **Real-time Validation**: All data operations validate decisions before writing

### **Benefits**

- **Data Consistency**: Only valid decision values can exist in the sheet
- **Reliable Sorting**: The `sort-by-status` command works with clean, valid data
- **User Experience**: Clear dropdown options prevent confusion and typos
- **Professional Quality**: Consistent data format for sharing and collaboration

## Enhanced Rescrape Functionality

The rescrape command now provides comprehensive coverage and better visibility:

### **Complete URL Coverage**

- **All URLs Processed**: Rescrapes every URL found in the sheet
- **Manual Listings Included**: Handles manually added listings automatically
- **Source Agnostic**: Works with listings from any rental site
- **No URL Left Behind**: Ensures all data stays fresh and current

### **Improved Visibility**

- **URL Count Display**: Shows exactly how many URLs are found
- **Progress Tracking**: Displays which listings are being processed
- **Notes Preservation Count**: Shows how many listings have notes that will be preserved
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive feedback during the rescraping process

### **Smart Data Preservation**

- **Sheet-Based Preservation**: Reads notes and decisions directly from the sheet
- **Cache-Independent**: Works even for listings without cache entries
- **Manual Edit Protection**: Preserves all your manual edits during rescraping
- **Dropdown Compatibility**: Ensures all decision values remain valid

### **Usage Examples**

```bash
# Rescrape all URLs while preserving manual edits
python main.py rescrape

# Force update all fields (ignore manual edits)
python main.py rescrape --ignore-hashes

# Skip confirmation prompts
python main.py rescrape --force

# Use a different sheet
python main.py rescrape --sheet-name "My Rentals"
```
